# ✈️ Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis & Prediction

## Project Overview

In today's competitive airline industry, understanding customer satisfaction is essential for improving service quality, retaining loyal passengers, and attracting new ones. This project aims to predict whether a passenger is satisfied or dissatisfied with their flight experience using objective travel data — without relying on subjective post-flight feedback.

By excluding service-related ratings and focusing on measurable features like travel class, flight delays, flight distance, and customer type, we build a realistic and generalizable machine learning model suitable for real-time prediction scenarios.

##  Goals

- Analyze key passenger attributes and travel details
- Build a predictive model for customer satisfaction
- Focus on objective, pre-flight and in-flight data
- Enable actionable insights for airlines to improve service proactively

## Workflow Summary

This project follows a structured data science pipeline:

### 1.Importing Libraries
Essential Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling were imported, including:
- `pandas`, `numpy` for data handling
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualization
- `scikit-learn`, `xgboost` for modeling

### 2.Data Exploration
Initial exploration included:
- Checking data shape and types
- Identifying missing values
- Understanding class distribution
- Reviewing feature correlations

### 3. Data Cleaning
Steps included:
- Handling missing values using data-driven imputation
- Dropping irrelevant or redundant columns
- Ensuring all features were numeric and properly formatted

### 4. Data Analysis
Key insights were drawn from:
- Class-wise satisfaction trends
- Delay impact on satisfaction
- Flight distance distributions

### 5.Data Transformation
Transformations included:
- Encoding categorical variables (e.g., Label Encoding)

### 6. Modeling & Evaluation
Multiple models were trained and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
